# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

My motivation for creating this guide was my drive to create a gui

I built this guide to create an all-inclusive showcase of my new-found skill, knowledge and understanding of the the bootcamp.

This problem solves accessbility into resources within the pre-course work.
